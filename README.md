## About the Project

This project is memorable to me because it was the last one I did for school. The subject was creating news about known histories, books, and others. The stories are only available in Portuguese. I used [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as style and [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) to handle all the news. I got the layout inspiration on images on internet.
